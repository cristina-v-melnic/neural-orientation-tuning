 Code for "Orientation selectivity can arise from distinct connectivity patterns" project.
 
### Structure
- [ ] Comment the second part of the stimulus_sweep.py
- [ ] Comment the utils file
- [ ] Comment the plotting files
- [ ] Separate data and processing
	- [ ] Separate the lif
	- [ ] Separate the sweep
	- [ ] Create some sample data and plots folders
- [ ] Change to object-oriented



### Experiments
- [ ] Robustness
	- [x] Weight deletion
	- [ ] Probability of firing
	- [ ] Probability of transmitting the spike
- [ ] Inhibition impact
	- [ ] PO distribution
	- [ ] Individual tuning
- [ ] Ring model
	- [ ] Self-sustained firing modelling memory
